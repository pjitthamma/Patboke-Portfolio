- Developed and evaluated a co-located mixed reality onboarding system that enables interactive see-through tutorials to improve VR interaction retention for novice users and seamless multi-user VR transitions from a shared physical space — featuring in an IEEE conference publication and an application available on Meta Horizon Store. Integrated technologies including Unity Netcode, Spatial Anchor API, Meta Mixed Reality Toolkit, Meta XR Interaction SDK, Meta XR Platform SDK.
- Developed a social virtual reality application, NPR Gallery, that engages users in exploring non-photorealistic shading techniques in a real-time 3D environment. The application features exhibit-style information points where users learn about various NPR effects and interactively apply these techniques to virtual objects. It was showcased at the university’s annual event, offering an educational and entertaining experience for visitors. Built using Photon PUN, XR Interaction Toolkit, and Unity Shader Lab.
- Developed a multi-user virtual reality application enabling users to explore virtual worlds either collectively or individually through a multi-ray jumping and positioning technique. This IEEE research inspired approach features a navigator-controlled group formation mechanism designed to reduce cognitive load and simulator sickness.
- Prototyped a VR based bomb assembly training simulator in 2015, leveraging Leap Motion for realistic hand interactions and Oculus Rift DK2 for immersive visualization. Evaluated with human subjects to demonstrate its potential safety benefits in military training procedures while reducing training costs and risks; developed in collaboration with the Defense Technology Institute under the Ministry of Defense of Thailand.
- Study foundational principles of VR interaction and XR development skills through various assignments and tutorials.
- Stay up-to-date with XR industry trends and best software practices.
