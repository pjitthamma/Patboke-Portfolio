My 1st VR project—a prototype simulator designed for aerial bomb assembly training. It featured realistic hand interactions using Leap Motion and immersive visuals with Oculus Rift DK2. Users could pick up individual bomb parts and follow step-by-step visual cues and instructions until fully assembling.

Developed in collaboration with [Thailand’s Defense Technology Institute](https://www.dti.or.th/index.php), the simulator aimed to offer safer, cost-effective training by eliminating risks associated with traditional military procedures.
