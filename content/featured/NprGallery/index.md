A social VR application designed for exploring non-photorealistic (NPR) shading techniques in real-time 3D. Visitors move freely through interactive exhibit booths, gaining insights about various NPR effects, and experimenting by applying these effects directly to digital objects.

The experience supports multiple users with built-in voice chat, creating a lively environment that blends collaborative learning with entertainment. Featured at the [universityâ€™s annual event](https://www.uni-weimar.de/de/medien/professuren/medieninformatik/vr/teaching/ss-2022/project-non-photorealistic-rendering-for-vr-applications).
