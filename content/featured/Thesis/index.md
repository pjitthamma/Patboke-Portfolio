This thesis explores the integration of chatbots with graphical web interfaces by developing and evaluating two web page prototypes: one with a simple chatbot for conversations and another where the chatbot interacts directly with the page (e.g., highlighting text, scrolling, triggering pop-ups). The goal is to assess user satisfaction, engagement, and design factors affecting the experience. The research includes analyzing existing technologies, identifying relevant approaches, implementing a prototype, and evaluating its usability and impact on user experience based on literature-driven requirements.
