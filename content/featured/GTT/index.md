A multi-user VR app that lets groups explore virtual worlds together using a simple yet powerful navigation system called multi-ray jumping. Inspired by [IEEE research](https://tim-weissker.de/preprints/2020-getting-there-together.pdf), the application reduces cognitive load and motion sickness by allowing one user to easily guide the group's movements, adjusting positions and directions intuitively.

The navigator first selects their own destination and then chooses positions for each group member within an adjustable circular zone. Once positions are set, the entire group teleports simultaneously to the chosen locations.
